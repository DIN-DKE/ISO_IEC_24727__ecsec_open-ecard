     * <li>if the response APDU has an SW1 of 61, the implementation should issue a {@code GET RESPONSE} command using

     * exchanges is concatenated to form the final response body.</li>
     * <li>if the response APDU is 6C XX, the implementation should reissue the command using XX as the Le field.</li>
